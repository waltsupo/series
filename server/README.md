## Insomnia workspace

`insomnia_workspace.json` contains request templates for all endpoints for quick access, and it should be kept up to date with endpoint changes. Changes are not automatically updated into workspace-file, so when changes are done, export workspace from Insomnia and replace the one in this folder.
